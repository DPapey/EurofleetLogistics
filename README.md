# Eurofleet Logistics C# Integration

## Intention
This project aims to implement the Eurofleet Logistics scenario schema and provide application-level interaction through a C# .NET backend. It serves as a foundational example of how robust database design, business logic, and API development can be integrated within a logistics context. 

## Database Schema
The Eurofleet Logistics database schema is structured according to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** design principles. This approach ensures a clear separation of concerns, reduces data redundancy, and enhances overall integrity. This schema models core logistics operations, including vehicles, staff, and assignments, and is optimised for transactional consistency and robust data-level constraints. 

## Application Architecture
The application is built using .NET Core Web API.
